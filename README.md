### User testing
Yelp is a popular platform for customers to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.). The purpose of Yelp is for its community of users to help other users find businesses.

We will be performing a usability test for Yelp. The purpose of usability tests is to evaluate a site's interface and notice flaws in its usability. Usability tests intend to improve a site from a user's perspective. Usability test sessions are recorded for analysis of user behavior and potential areas for improvement. In the tests, users are asked to complete a short series of tasks and describe their process of completing said tasks. 

For Yelp, the usability issues I found from my heuristic reviews were as follows:
- Difficulties in filtering search results
- Sponsored results distort actual search results
- Certain site features are difficult to find

For my usability test, I performed it in my dorm using my personal laptop. I used ActivePresenter to record my usability test. The session recorded the screen, me and the user, and audio.

This usability test is a pilot test, and my roommate was the user.

The process of the usability test was as follows:
1. Background questions
2. Previous experience questions
3. Pre-test questions
4. Tasks
5. Post-test questions
6. SUS questionnaire
7. Product satisfaction card
8. Demographics

The following results were measured:
- Ease of use
- Frequency of use
- Learn ability
- Trustworthiness
- Site organization
- Site content
- How the user felt after using site
